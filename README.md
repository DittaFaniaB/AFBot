### How to run it

#### Install software

#### Automated execution

To make the script autonomous one can do it in several steps. You can use for example Docker and Cron-jobs.
The easiest way of these two are Cron-jobs. Please see the guide for your respective OS to apply the script using Cron-jobs:
